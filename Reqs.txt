One of our restaurant clients wants to know which pizza topping combinations are the most popular. 

Using a language in our technical stack, write an app or script that will download orders directly from http://files.olo.com/pizzas.json and output the top 20 most frequently ordered pizza topping combinations. List the toppings for each popular pizza topping combination along with its rank and the number of times that combination has been ordered.

For best results, focus on accuracy and brevity. Our estimate for this exercise is 30 minutes.
